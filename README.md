## ⚡ The Problem
Switching contexts to pick up a phone, open an app, and wait for it to load just to turn on a light or fan is a friction point. When I am at my PC, I want to control my environment *from* my PC.

## 💡 The Solution
**IOT-Bridge** is a custom Web Application hosted on my Home Server. It bypasses the need for the mobile app by using custom Python scripts to interface directly with device APIs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project utilizes a hybrid architecture to ensure low latency and accessibility:

* **Frontend:** React (JavaScript) – *User Interface*
* **Backend:** Python – *API Wrapper & HTTP Requests*
* **Hosting:**
    * **Primary:** Home Server (Self-Hosted for local control)
    * **Demo:** Vercel (Public preview)
