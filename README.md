# IOT-Bridge is a Web Application that will be hosted using my Home Server and Vercel(DEMO).
1. IOT-Bridge will be used so that I can access my smart home devices or appliances without opening my phone and watch.
2. I will also be using the API or HTTP request that I made using Python

# Why I made it?
I found reaching, opening my phone and TAPO application a hassle when I'm using my PC so I'll just build a Web App so that I can open it using my PC

# I'll update the Readme SOON. Tinatamad ako.
